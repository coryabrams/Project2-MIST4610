# Scenario Description
This iteration of our project evolves project 1 with new entities and queries. The main purpose is to build a relational database to manage the operations of a movie production and distribution company. At the center of the model is the Movie entity, representing the films produced by the company and distributed across various channels, including theaters and streaming platforms. The database will also track related elements such as actors, directors, revenue, reviews, and ratings. The objective is to design an accurate representation of the relationships between these entities, generate sample data to populate the database, and execute queries that provide insights into the performance and public reception of the company's films. Our main goal is to monitor the success of films across different distribution channels, analyze audience reception through reviews and aggregate ratings, track box office revenue and analyze financial performance by country, and identify trends in director and actor collaborations, as well as popular genres. Using this data we are able to identify top grossing films by country and genre, determine which streaming platforms are most profitable for each genre, and most importantly analyze the relationship between film reviews/ratings and overall box office success. We are hoping that this database can serve as a helpful tool for business analysis and profitability forecasting, and can help companies confidently make decisions backed by data in areas such as production, marketing, and distribution. Our database offers in depth analytics, such as the ability to compare box office performance across multiple countries (which could be helpful in international market campaigns). Additionally, this database could be used to track actors' success across multiple genres, under center directors, and identify who is a star in the industry. Another problem our database solves is consumer engagement. By integrating personalized from customers using data from ratings, reviews, viewing patterns, etc companies are able to boost overall customer satisfaction.

# Data Model
![FINAL FINAL FINAL Data Model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b59a1e7b-d456-4594-9bbd-1b424e997546)
Since we are expanding what we completed in project 1 into project 2, we felt it was important to highlight the differences and changes made. Firstly, using the new information about advanced SQL, we were able to change table and column names with ease that were previously incorrectly labeled and to update existing entities. Our biggest addition is the Many to Many Recursive relationship between the Actor table, as there are many actor collaborations that take place in movies - not necessarily just one star actor. Additionally, we were able to add Modality and Cardinality to the model, showing whether an input should be required from entity to entity.

# Data Dictionary

# Query 1: Create a view that calculates the average rating for each genre

Justification: Calculating the average rating for each genre allows managers to gain insight into audeince preferences and market trends. It can allow the manager to optimize their rating by aligning their movie with market trends and audience preferences. This can allow them to increase their revenue. Movies with higher ratings generally have a higher revenue.

# Query 2: Create a procedure that takes multiple parameters to filter movies by genre and range of release years

Justification: Creating a procedure that filters movie by genre and release date allows managers to analyze trends within a specific genre over time. This allows managers to understand historical data so that they can tailor their movie to keep up with current market trends. This can lead to an increase in revenue for future movies.

# Query 3: Create a procedure that specifies an actor's name to output the total amount of movies that them and all other actors are in
<img width="348" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-02 at 7 33 50 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05dafe34-3f39-49a5-b2a4-27f4ef0fa64b">

Justification: Creating a procedure that outputs the total number of movies actors have been in is valueable for understanding collaboration patterns. Actors who often work together can lead to higher audience engagenment, which can also lead to a more successful box office.
